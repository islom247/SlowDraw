# SlowDraw
CS 464 (Introduuction to Machine Learning) project.  

Main purpose of the project is doodle classification.  
The program aims to recognize the doodles  
drawn by the user on the GUI, classify into which category  
the drawn image belongs to, and report back all the details  
to the user in real time.  
We used Keras library to create Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to train the data.  
Dataset: Google's "Quick, Draw!" dataset (available on Google Cloud Storage).
